# Zombie Walk 3D 🧟‍♂️

A high-performance 3D character demo optimized for mobile web and Android.

## 🚀 Overview
This project features a fully animated zombie character designed for smooth performance in [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction). It is part of a larger mobile game development pipeline.

## 🛠 Technical Optimization
* **Bone Limit:** Optimized with a **4-bone influence limit** per vertex to ensure compatibility with mobile GPUs and avoid Three.js skinning errors.
* **Performance:** High-quality character mesh (~18k vertices) at a lightweight file size of **<100 KB**.
* **Format:** Delivered via `.glb` (glTF Binary) to lock in textures and animations in a single high-speed file.

## 🎨 Asset Licensing & Credits
* **3D Model:** Base mesh generated using [Rodin AI](https://hyper3d.ai/) (Commercial license included).
* **Animations:** Rigging and walking animations provided by [Adobe Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) (Royalty-free for commercial use).
* **Scripting:** Built and tested using [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
